# FLUIDITY

### A fully responsive css framework that is impossibly small

HTML is already 99% responsive out of the box.
This stylesheet fixes the remaining ~1%, in 247 minified bytes.
Let's make the web just a bit more responsive, shall we?

## Installing fluidity

#### Production

Just include the fluidity css file in the head of your html file:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fluidity.min.css">
```

For elements that need to retain widths that might be wider than a device's
viewport (i.e tables), wrap them in a div with the class 'overflow-container'
like so:
```html
  <div class="overflow-container">
    <table>
      ...
    </table>
  </div>
```

#### Development

If you want to develop with the uncompressed version, include instead:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fluidity.css">
```

## Available build / dev tools

If you'd like to use the available build tools just run:
```
cd fluidity
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
```

## Gulp Tasks

Gulp is a JavaScript task runner.
http://gulpjs.com

There are a few common tasks that gulp takes care of here:
* Livereload
* CSS minification
* Autoprefixer
* Sass
* Lints the compiled css

Run these from the root directory of the project. The command
```
gulp
```
runs a live reload server and starts sass compilation while running csslint, while
```
gulp production
```
also minifies the css.
